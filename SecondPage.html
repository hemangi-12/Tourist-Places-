    <h2>Sihagad Fort</h2>
    <p>At a distance of 32 km from Pune Junction, Sinhagad or Sinhagarh means the Lion Fort, is a fortress located southwest of Pune City. Sinhagad Fort is one of the popular places of trekking in Maharashtra, and among the must include places in Pune packages</p>
    <p>Previously called Kondana, the fort has been the site of many important battles, most notably the Battle of Sinhagad in 1671 CE. It is one of the top places to visit near Pune City. According to history, the fort was built 2,000 years ago and it is said that the name Kondana was derived from sage Kaundinya. Mohammed bin Tughalak captured the fort from the Koli tribal chieftain, Nag Naik in 1340 CE. And in 1496 CE, Malik Ahmad, the founder of the Nizam Shahi dynasty took control of the fort.</p>
    <p>Nearly 200 years later, the Maratha leader Shahaji Bhonsale captured the fort. In 1647 CE, Shivaji held the stronghold and renamed it Sinhagad. In 1665 CE, as per the Treaty of Purandar, Shivaji handed over Sinhagad to the Mughals and again captured it in 1670 CE, under the direction of Tanaji who was Shivaji's favorite general. Aurangzeb laid siege to Sinhagad in 1701- 03 CE, but could not hold it for long. Finally the British seized the fort from the Marathas in 1818 AD. The fort was later used as a retreat for many European residents of Pune.</p>
    <p>Counted as one of the famoustourist places in Pune, Sinhagad was an important fort because of its strategic location perched on an isolated cliff of the Bhuleswar range of Sahyadri Mountains, 1,312 m above sea level. The fort is naturally protected due to its very steep slopes. As such, walls and bastions were constructed at only key places. The fort has two gates - the Kalyan Darwaja in the southeast and the Pune Darwaja in the northeast, both protected by three successive gates. The fort contains Kaundinyeshwar Temple, a memorial to Tanaji, the tomb of Rajaram, Lokmanya Tilak Smarak, Amruteshwar Temple, and Devtake. Military stables, a brewery, and a Kali Temple are also located within the complex.</p>

        <h2>Shaniwar Wada</h2>
        <p>At a distance of 3 km from Pune Junction, Shaniwar Wada is an ancient palace fort situated in the center of Pune in Maharashtra. This one of the most popular historical places to visit in Pune.
          <p> Built in 1732 AD, Shaniwar Wada was the seat of the Peshwa rulers of the Maratha Empire until 1818 AD when the Peshwas surrendered to the British after the Third Anglo-Maratha War. Following the rise of the Maratha Empire, the palace became the center of Indian politics in the 18th century. It is one of the must-visit places as part of Pune tour packages.</p>
        <p>Shaniwar Wada was originally built as the residence of the Peshwas. The foundation of the mansion was laid by Bajirao I in 1730 AD and the construction was completed in 1732 AD. It is said that the foundation was carried out on a Saturday, hence the palace got the name 'Shaniwar' (Saturday), 'Wada' (residence). Influenced by Mughal design and architecture, Shaniwar Wada represents the skillful craftsmanship of Maratha artisans and boasts about 21 feet tall main door that faces north. The palace was built using teak that was imported from the jungles of Junnar, stone brought from quarries of Chinchwad, and lime sourced from the lime-belts of Jejuri. Several additions were made to the palace like fortification walls with bastions, gates and court halls by his successors.</p>
            
            <p>This seven storied structure was largely destroyed in 1828 CE by a fire accident. Only the remains can be seen now like the fortification walls with five gateways and nine bastions that enclosed the entire palace. The principal gate is called Dilli Darwaja (Delhi Gate); the other gates are called Mastani or Alibahadur Darwaja, Khidki Darwaja, Ganesh Darwaja and Narayan Darwaja. There is a statue of Bajirao I on a horse in front of Shaniwar Wada. The fort stands amidst a beautiful landscape which contains water channels and different shaped ponds. Inside one can see Ganesh Mahal, Rang Mahal, Aarsa (Mirror) Mahal, Hasti Dant Mahal, Diwan Khana and Fountains. The walls in the palace were painted with scenes from Ramayana and Mahabharata. A sixteen petal lotus-shaped fountain stands reminiscent of the exquisite work of those times.</p>
            
            <p>The historical structure is now maintained by the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC). People can enjoy the 1 hour light and sound show at the monument while visiting the Shaniwar Wada. The show runs in both Marathi and English.</p>

        <p>At a distance of 6.5 km from Pune Junction, the Aga Khan Palace is a national monument of India's independence movement. It is situated on Pune - Nagar Road and is one of the prominent tourist places in Pune.</p>
        <p>Aga Khan Palace is considered to be one of the greatest palaces in Maharashtra, and among the must-visit places as part of Pune tour packages. The Palace was built by Sultan Mohammed Shah Aga Khan III in 1892 AD. The palace was an act of charity by the Sultan who wanted
